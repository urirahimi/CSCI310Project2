Feature: Collage page appearance
    The collage page has to have an appearance identical to what's specified by the stakeholders.

  Scenario: I am navigating to the collage page                                                # collage_page_appearance.feature:4
    Given I submitted a valid topic on the main page                                           # step_definitions/collage_page_appearance_steps.rb:8
    Then A loading symbol should appear until I see the collage page                           # step_definitions/collage_page_appearance_steps.rb:14
    Then An export collage button is shown                                                     # step_definitions/collage_page_appearance_steps.rb:22
    Then A save collage button is shown                                                        # step_definitions/collage_page_appearance_steps.rb:27
    Then An input box for re-entering a topic is shown                                         # step_definitions/collage_page_appearance_steps.rb:33
    But The input box for topic has placeholder text                                           # step_definitions/collage_page_appearance_steps.rb:38
    Then A rectangle that displays miniaturized images of previous collages generated is shown # step_definitions/collage_page_appearance_steps.rb:43
    Then A collage is shown                                                                    # step_definitions/collage_page_appearance_steps.rb:48
    Given I submitted an invalid topic on the main page                                        # step_definitions/collage_page_appearance_steps.rb:53
    Then A loading symbol should still appear until I see the collage page                     # step_definitions/collage_page_appearance_steps.rb:59
    Then An error message is shown                                                             # step_definitions/collage_page_appearance_steps.rb:67
    Then All UI elements besides the collage is the same                                       # step_definitions/collage_page_appearance_steps.rb:72
