  Scenario: I am generating a collage with the photos rotated. # collage_options.feature:4
    Given I am at the landing page                             # step_definitions/collage_options_steps.rb:1
      TODO (Cucumber::Pending)
      ./step_definitions/collage_options_steps.rb:2:in `"I am at the landing page"'
      collage_options.feature:5:in `Given I am at the landing page'

    And I submit a valid topic for a collage to be rotated     # step_definitions/collage_options_steps.rb:9
    Then The collage generated should be rotated               # step_definitions/collage_options_steps.rb:13
    When I select the Photo Borders option                     # collage_options.feature:9
    And I submit a valid topic for a collage with borders      # step_definitions/collage_options_steps.rb:25

    When I select the Sepia option                             # step_definitions/collage_options_steps.rb:33
    And I submit a valid topic for a collage in sepia tone     # step_definitions/collage_options_steps.rb:37
    Then The collage generated should be in sepia tone         # step_definitions/collage_options_steps.rb:41
    When I select the Grayscale option                         # step_definitions/collage_options_steps.rb:45
    And I submit a valid topic for a collage in grayscale      # step_definitions/collage_options_steps.rb:49
    Then The collage generated should be in grayscale          # step_definitions/collage_options_steps.rb:53
